  <h2>Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are in the EEA or UK, we process personal data on the following legal bases: (i) performance of a contract
    with you; (ii) legitimate interests (to operate, secure, and improve the Services); (iii) compliance with legal
    obligations; and (iv) your consent (for certain features or marketing where required). You may withdraw consent at
    any time without affecting prior processing.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    We use cookies and similar technologies to enable essential functionality, measure performance, remember your
    preferences, and deliver content. You can manage cookies through your browser or device settings. Blocking some
    cookies may impair features or functionality. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals due to a lack of
    industry standard. Where applicable law requires consent for certain cookies, we will obtain and honor your choices.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
  <p>
    We may share information in the following circumstances, with appropriate safeguards and subject to applicable law:

  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal information as the term “sell” is defined by applicable U.S. state laws. We also do not
    “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising except where you have consented or enabled
    such features; you can opt out of such sharing by contacting us as described below.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, to comply with legal obligations,
    to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of data and
    the purposes for which we use it. When retention is no longer necessary, we will delete or de-identify information
    subject to technical and legal constraints.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect personal information against
    unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. No system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
    security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity
    that occurs under your account.
  </p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    SurgeFitMax may process and store information in the United States and other countries. When transferring personal
    data outside your country, we use lawful mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses, and implement
    appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable laws. By using the Services, you understand that your information
    may be transferred to jurisdictions with different data protection rules than your country.
